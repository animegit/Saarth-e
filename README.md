##About

Saarth-e is a user interface built using Flutter that helps you discover colleges based on your preferred courses. By utilizing a sorting algorithm, the app recommends colleges and schools that fit your criteria. It provides detailed information on your chosen college or school, including reviews, descriptions, ratings, locations, and available facilities. Additionally, the app allows you to easily book nearby hostel rooms both within and outside the campus.
